# Project Title
Predicting Student Scores Using Regression Analysis

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can predict student scores based on various academic and demographic factors. The model will be trained on a dataset containing student details such as grades, age, gender, family background, etc. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features. The model will be evaluated using various regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

# Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
- Develop a regression model using sci-kit-learn or TensorFlow
- Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using regression metrics
- Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters and feature selection
- Deploy the model in a web application or API for real-time predictions

# Project Deliverables
- A Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, training, and evaluation
- A report summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions
- A web application or API for real-time predictions
